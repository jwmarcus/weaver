> "A day is the sum of its parts, not the duration of its events." -John Marcus III

Imagine your life as a giant, detailed artwork made of fabric. This artwork, called a tapestry, is not made all at once, but is woven together bit by bit, color by color, to create an image or pattern. In the context of the Weaver app, each tiny bit of thread in this tapestry represents a "Moment" – like hanging out with friends, studying for a test, or taking a short walk.

"Mosaics" are like smaller sections of this tapestry, where similar threads (or moments) are grouped together to form a pattern or picture. For example, all the moments related to your hobby of painting could form a "Painting" mosaic, showing a pattern of creativity and learning.

A tapestry, then, is a larger, overarching theme or goal in your life, made up of several of these mosaics. Think of it as a big picture composed of different areas of your life – like "Being Healthy," "Learning New Skills," or "Building Strong Relationships." Each of these areas is a tapestry in itself, woven from many mosaics.

So, when we talk about having multiple tapestries, like "Being a Good Parent" and "Taking Care of Myself with Compassion," it's like saying you're working on several big areas or themes of your life simultaneously. Each tapestry is made up of different patterns (mosaics) of moments that you've lived, showing the diverse and multifaceted nature of who you are and what you care about.

In the Weaver app, you're the artist, deciding which moments to add and how they come together to form mosaics and, ultimately, the grand tapestries of your life.

# How to weave

**Moments:**

A moment is a fundamental, qualitative unit of activity or experience, reflecting the essence or intention behind an action rather than its duration or complexity. It's about the immediate experience or the smallest spark of action, embodying the initial intention or thought that leads to a task. This aligns well with focusing on the quality of activities rather than their temporal measurement.

**Mosaics:**

A mosaic is a building block of experience or intention, rather than a segment of time. These mosaics can be activities, goals, or themes that users want to incorporate into their life. A day, then, becomes a canvas on which these mosaics are placed, regardless of how many days a particular mosaic spans.

Some mosaics might span a single day, focusing on specific activities or experiences the user wants to achieve within that day. Others could stretch over multiple days, representing ongoing projects or themes the user is weaving into their life. This approach allows for long-term goals and recurring themes to be part of the planning process, acknowledging that not all important activities are confined to a single day.

**Tapestries:**

A tapestry represents a comprehensive, thematic collection of experiences and intentions that span across multiple mosaics. It's an overarching narrative or journey within an individual's life, reflecting broad, long-term goals or fundamental aspects of personal identity. Each tapestry is woven from the threads of various mosaics, showcasing how different activities, goals, and themes intricately interact and contribute to the realization of larger aspirations or the embodiment of core values.

Tapestries are not bound by time in the traditional sense but are defined by the depth and breadth of personal growth, achievement, and reflection they represent. They encompass the multitude of mosaics an individual chooses to engage with, each contributing to the development of the tapestry's theme or purpose. For example, a tapestry could represent a life goal such as "Living a Fulfilling Life," composed of mosaics like "Nurturing Relationships," "Personal Health," and "Career Growth." These mosaics, in turn, are built from moments that capture the essence of each action or experience within those areas.

**Daily Composition:**

Users begin by selecting mosaics that resonate with their intentions for the near term. They then organize these mosaics to shape their day, focusing on what they wish to experience or accomplish. The composition of a day becomes an intentional arrangement of mosaics, prioritizing meaningful activities over rigid scheduling.

Iterative Reflection and Planning: Encourage users to reflect on the mosaics of their past days and to think ahead about future mosaics. This reflective practice allows them to adjust their approach, add new mosaics, or extend the span of current ones, fostering a dynamic and intentional way of living.

Visual Representation: To facilitate this model, consider offering a visual representation where mosaics can be visually placed onto a representation of a day or days. This can help users see how their activities—free from time constraints—fit into the broader picture of their week or month, emphasizing the flow and balance of their chosen mosaics.

By framing days as compositions of mosaics, you're enabling users to think more about the content and quality of their time rather than the chronological constraints. This model promotes a more flexible and intentional approach to daily planning, where the focus is on living meaningfully.

**The Void Mosaic:**

The Void Mosaic: In the framework of Weaver, where life is artfully segmented into moments, mosaics, and tapestries, the Void Mosaic holds a unique place. Unlike other mosaics that are built with intention and purpose, the Void Mosaic is where unintentional tasks and experiences accumulate. These are activities that occur outside the realm of planned moments and mosaics, often reflecting the spontaneous, unplanned, or even distracting parts of our day.

Think of the Void Mosaic as the space for everything that wasn't intentionally woven into the fabric of your day but found its way in anyway. This could include moments of procrastination, unplanned interruptions, or any activity that diverted you from your intended tasks or goals. It serves as a reflective tool, allowing users to see where their time might be leaking away to unintended or less meaningful activities.

The purpose of identifying and reflecting on the Void Mosaic isn't to judge or criticize oneself for deviating from planned intentions but to gain awareness of how these unintentional moments affect the larger picture of our lives. By recognizing patterns within the Void Mosaic, users can make more informed decisions about how to allocate their time, energy, and focus in the future, potentially transforming some of these void moments into intentional parts of their mosaics and tapestries.

In essence, the Void Mosaic offers a space for reflection and growth, highlighting the contrast between intention and happenstance. It underscores the importance of mindfulness and intentionality in crafting a life that truly reflects one's values, goals, and desires, acknowledging that every moment—intentional or not—plays a part in the grand tapestry of life.
